									Dr. Hank is committed to protecting your privacy. We provide this policy to explain the type of information we collect and to inform you of the specific practices and guidelines that protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information, including health information that individually identifies you, or protected health information (“PHI”).

								<p class="privacy__text">We do not provide any medical services through the Website or the App. We can store a request for medical services and forward that request to a licensed health care provider in the United States. After you make a request through the App, Dr. Hank contact your healthcare provider or will nominate one or more doctors, licensed in the state from which you request treatment, to work on your request. These providers who work on your request will have the same rights to the personal information and PHI as Dr. Hank as set forth here.</p>

								<li class="privacy__text">about your medical condition, treatment options, physician referrals, prescriptions, and lab results, including PHI or other related health information.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="privacy__text">We collect this information:</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="privacy__text">Directly from you when you provide it to us.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Automatically as you navigate through the site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">From third parties intermediaries, for example, the physicians, medical professionals, and pharmacies with whom we partner to provide you with services.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="privacy__text">Information You Give to Us. The information we collect on or through our Website or the App may include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="privacy__text">Information that you provide on our Website or the App. This includes information provided when you sign up for our services; when we process or respond to your inquiries related to requests for treatment, payment, customer service; and when you provide feedback on our Website or the App.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Your responses to questions that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Details of transactions you carry out through our Website and the App and of the fulfillment of your inquiries or requests.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Your search queries on the Website.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="privacy__text">Information We Collect About You. As with many other websites and mobile applications, as you navigate through and interact with our Website or the App, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="privacy__text">Details of your visits to our Website or the App, including traffic data, location data, logs, language, date and time of access, frequency, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website or the App.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, host domain, and browser type.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Details of referring websites (URL). We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="privacy__text">The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information you provide to us or that we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our Website or the App and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="privacy__text">Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website or the App according to your individual interests.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Speed up your searches.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">Recognize you when you return to our Website or the App.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="privacy__text">Cookies Used on This Website. Our Website and the App uses two types of cookies: single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Temporary cookies last only as long as your web browser is open, and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through our Website or the App. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods and are used for purposes including tracking the number of unique visitors to our site and information such as the number of views a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page, and other pertinent web statistics. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by Dr. Hank to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit the Website or the App. We do not respond to ‘do not track’ signals in your browser. We may also collect data by using “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “pixel tags”) that allow us to know when you visit our Website or the App. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information that can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.</p>
							<p class="privacy__text">Information We Receive From Other Sources. This is information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, third parties intermediaries, such as the physicians, medical professionals, and pharmacies with whom we partner to provide you with services, sub-contractors in technical, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers).</p>

								<li class="privacy__text">In order to ensure that content from our Website and the App is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile phone, to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service (when you choose to do so), and as part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure.</li>
								<li class="privacy__text">To communicate with you about our products and services and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies and any of their related businesses and those of our third-party partners.</li>
